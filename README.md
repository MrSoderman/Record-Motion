# Tiny Motion Capture & Playback

A minimal, dependency-free JavaScript tool for capturing and replaying pointer-based motion (mouse, touch, or pen). Designed for creative coding, animation prototyping, UI testing, or just fun gesture experiments.

## Features

- **Universal input:** Records mouse, touch, or pen via the Pointer Events API
- **Live recording:** Real-time capture of pointer movement
- **Playback:** Replays motion frame-by-frame
- **Save:** Exports raw motion data to a JSON file
- **Load:** Drag-and-drop a saved file to replay it
- **Responsive:** Runs on desktop and mobile
- **Lightweight:** Pure HTML/CSS/JS, no dependencies

## How to Use

1. **Draw:** Press and hold on the canvas to begin recording.
2. **Release:** Stop recording and start playback automatically.
3. **Save:** Click “Save Motion” to download a `.json` file.
4. **Load:** Drop a saved file onto the drop zone to replay it.

## File Format

Recorded motions are stored as an array of `{ x, y }` objects:

```json
[
  { "x": 150, "y": 300 },
  { "x": 152, "y": 302 },
  ...
]
```
